1. In FailureRecovery.h
   - use correct parameter for SLOTS of cluster
   - Disable "hostNameToLaunch[i] = (char *)"mohsin";" for 
     running on cluster

2. In run2dAdvect
   - use "--mca coll_ftbasic_method 3" for more than one 
     process failure

3. In "FailureRecovery.h"
   - use "usleep(10000);" in "mpiErrorHandler(...)" for 
     testing on a small number of processes
   - without using "usleep(10000);" in "mpiErrorHandler(...)" 
     on a larger number of processes for more than one process
     failure causes frequent hangs on, but it causes additional
     delay as well
   - use "hostNameToLaunch[i] = (char *)"mohsin";", where 
     "mohsin" is the hostname, in "repairComm(...)" to run
     and test on that host
   - "OMPI_Comm_revoke(...)" may reported as ERROR in 
     "communicatorReconstruct(...)", but the application 
     runs successfully
